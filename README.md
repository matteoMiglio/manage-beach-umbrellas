# Manage Beach Umbrellas

Manage Beach Umbrellas is a web application that helps keep track of subscriptions and reservations of beach umbrellas that customers rent. 
It can be used by a beach resort's owner to manage subscriptions and their payments, also it can be used to daily consult the planimetry of the beach to understand which umbrellas are free and which are reserved.

## ðŸ¥… Purpose of this project

This project was developed to help a friend of mine to manage his beach resort.

## ðŸ›  Development Method

I focused on developing to deliver the app as fast as I could. So, I didn't care so much about security, also because the app is deployed to a Rasberry Pi which is connected to a private LAN not accessible by anyone.

There is no authentication to access the app.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

* Front-end: React 
* Back-end: Django

## ðŸ’¡ Functionalities

* You can visualize day by day the planimetry of the beach where you can find out the umbrellas free and reserved.

* You have a calendar page where you select a beach umbrella, and the app tells you his reservation through the season.

* There is a table for subscriptions where you can manage the subscriptions for beach umbrellas.

* There is a table for reservations where you can manage reservations for beach umbrellas filtered by a day.
