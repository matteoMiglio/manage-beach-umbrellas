# Manage Beach Umbrellas

Manage Beach Umbrellas is a web application that helps keeping track of subscriptions and reservations of beach umbrellas that customers rent. It can be used by a beach resort owner to manage subscriptions and their payments, also it can be used to consult the planimetry of the beach daily in order to understand which umbrellas are free and which are reserved.

## ðŸ¥… Purpose of this project

This project was developed to help a friend of mine manage his beach resort.

## ðŸ›  Development Method

Since I focused on developing the app to deliver it as fast as I could, I didn't care too much about security. Additionally the app is deployed to a Raspberry Pi which is connected to a LAN not accessible by anyone.

There is no authentication to access the app.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

* Front-end: React 
* Back-end: Django

## ðŸ’¡ Functionalities

* You can visualize the planimetry of the beach day by day and you can find out which umbrellas are free and which are reserved.

* You have a calendar web page where you select a beach umbrella, and the app tells you its availability throughout the season.

* There is a table for subscriptions where you can manage the subscriptions for beach umbrellas.

* There is a table for reservations where you can manage reservations for beach umbrellas filtered by date.
